1.
I am going to create a app with the help of you, the app will be developed in C/C++ and I am stuyding at a vocational college.

This is the app initial idea of the app " File organization tool - with TUI -Text User Interface - that allows moving between folders, renaming all files in a folder, partial renaming of files according to for example a regex pattern or with an extension concatenated to the existing name."

Please start of by creating a list of functions that need to be implemented for this app to work.

2.
Please create code and files for these functions: List Directory Contents Display files and folders in the current directory. Handle pagination for large directories.

Navigate Directories
    Change the current directory (e.g., cd functionality).
    Provide navigation shortcuts like .. (parent directory).

Rename Files
    Rename all files in a directory to a uniform format.
    Append custom extensions to filenames.

Batch Rename with Regex
    Apply regex patterns to rename files partially (e.g., search and replace text in filenames).

File Sorting
    Sort files by name, size, date modified, or type.
    Option to organize files into subfolders based on criteria (e.g., by file type).

File Filtering
    Filter files displayed based on patterns or extensions.

Copy/Move Files
    Copy or move files between directories.

Delete Files
    Delete selected files (with a confirmation prompt).

Help me create a cmake for this project

4.
Help me create implementations for these functions:

void renameFiles() {
    // Implementation for renaming files
}

// Prompt 2
void batchRenameWithRegex() {
    // Implementation for batch renaming with regex
}

// Prompt 2
void fileSorting() {
    // Implementation for sorting files
}

// Prompt 2
void fileFiltering() {
    // Implementation for filtering files
}

// Prompt 2
void copyMoveFiles() {
    // Implementation for copying/moving files
}

// Prompt 2
void deleteFiles() {
    // Implementation for deleting files
}

5.
create a readme for the project with indepth instructions of how you are supposed to use each function.
